        Just yesterday, the home of the Dermije mayor, Elvegzik Karvanij, was burned down as he was giving his speech in support of his proposal to cut the the Dermije Urban Rail Corporation's budget in city hall. His plan to cut rail spending was met with considerable backlash when it was first announced, and the Ilasrom police contractors suspect that this is arson perpetrated by one of his dissenters. None have claimed responsibility for the crime, and the identity of the arsonist is unknown. However, Ilasrom has linked the cause of the fire to a rogue software update delivered to several of Elvegzik's smart candles which allowed attackers to activate and control the intensity of the flame over the internet. The maker of the smart candles, Sevorod Lifestyle, has issued a recall of their Mood-lit Smart Candle series following this revelation.

        The Sevorod Mood-lit Smart Candles use mana to change the colour of the flame and provided an app for users to control the candle. According to Ilasrom, Karvanij's smart candles were hacked as early as February 20th, about a week after Karvanij announced his cutbacks. The candles' usage logs indicated that one of the candles recieved a malicious firmware update over the internet, which it then propagated to the rest of the smart candles in his home network. On the day of Kervanij's speech, the attacker destabilized the mana control matrix in the smart candles, creating several fireballs which burned his house down.

      <blockquote class="f3 i bl pl3 fr-ns w-30-ns">We need police. We need to beef up our police budget. And this fire thing is why. That's why I'm cutting the trains.</blockquote>
      <p>
        Despite the arson, Mayor Karvanij is still adamant about his current budget proposal. "Somewhere out there is a sad, sad guy in his mother's basement," said Karvanij in a video response this morning, "A sad sack with too much time on your hands. You know what we need? Instead of trains? We need police. We need to beef up our police budget. And this fire thing is why. That's why I'm cutting the trains."

        Meanwhile, Sevorod smart candle users are outraged over the deadly risks of their candles' lack of security. We've seen smart home devices compromised before. In fact, smart home devices have seen its fair share of attacks since they were first introduced decades ago. Hackers have compromised customers' smart fridges and smart thermostats and made them part of botnets that are used to take down web services. However, this is the first time we've seen a vulnerability so bad that it could endanger the lives of anyone who owns a compromised device.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following this event, Sevorod Lifestyle has issued a general recall for their Mood-lit Smart Candle series in Malaszec and other countries over concerns that other people's smart candles might be compromised in the same way. To see affected models and which countries the recall applies in, see <a href="https://sevorod.ma/international/mood-icandle-recall">the Sevorod Lifestyle website</a>.
