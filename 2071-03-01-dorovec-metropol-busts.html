        The Dorovec Metropolitan Police (Metropol) arrested seven members of the Argjan drone cartel and raided a warehouse containing tens of thousands of counterfeit passenger drones in Dorovec's Dwarf Quarter this morning. Over the past several months, hobby drones being sold as passenger drones have been plaguing the skies of Malaszec without the proper safety equipment required of a genuine passenger drone, responsible for twelve drone-related accidents in Dorovec last month alone. The arrest of the Argjan cartel members has been attributed to a successful undercover operation by Metropol Detective Tjal Kad, who is due to receive her Meritorious Service Honour next week.

      <p>
        In the east wing of the warehouse, incoming off-the-shelf hobby drones from <i>Toys n' More</i> would be outfitted with faerie-sized seats and hacked Right-of-Way Negotiation Transponders (RNTs), which tap into a city's traffic control systems and pretends to be a legitimate passenger drone. The three hackers arrested, Asal Kaslij (human, 31), Darjan Kaslij (human, 35), and Tevan Felijan (elf, 64) were also responsible for a virus that took down right-of-way systems for autonomous cars in several cities last year. Once the counterfeit RNTs were installed, drone would be given a new paint job and fake vehicle badges in order to pass as the real thing. Tens of thousands of these fake drones, piled high to the ceiling in the warehouse's west wing, would be shipped off and sold at prices too good to be true for passenger drones.

        "Fake RNTs are particularly dangerous because unlike real ones, they don't get updated with new software when it comes out. If the protocol for the traffic controller on the ground changes, the fake RNT isn't going to know about it, and as a result, it's not going to know about all the other drones that are flying in the sky either. That means you're putting yourself in danger, and putting everyone around you in danger too," says Metropol Traffic Chief Narod Avastij, "If you're lucky, the traffic controller will detect that your RNT isn't a real one and refuse to put you in the traffic pattern. So at best you'll be stuck with a worthless drone-shaped piece of junk, and at worst, you're stuck injured under a piece of junk formerly shaped like a drone."
      </p>
      <p>
        The other four arrested members of the drone cartel, Estan Kadro (human, 28), Ril Oset (45), Avos Dorovec (elf, 68), and Vanij Kostoven (faerie, 21), were involved in various parts of the counterfeiting process. In addition to the arrests, thousands of Proj worth of automated fabrication equipment and turret guard drones were seized, and bank accounts associated with the warehouse have been shut down. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this was a major blow to the Argjan cartel's criminal operations, Metropol believe this was only one key part of a larger counterfeiting operation. A federal task force is being created with the backing of Malaszec's passenger drone manufacturers to investigate passenger drone counterfeiting and take as many dangerous hacked drones off the skies as possible.
